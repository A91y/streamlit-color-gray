# AyDecoloriser
I'm excited to share my recent project, the AyDecoloriser app. It's my first venture into web app development using Streamlit, and I'm thrilled with the results.

This app utilizes OpenCV to decolorize images, all while offering a unique and user-friendly interface thanks to Juxtapose. And the best part? It's all done using Python, no HTML or CSS required.
